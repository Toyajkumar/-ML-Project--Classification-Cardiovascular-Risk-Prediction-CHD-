# Classification - Cardiovascular Risk Prediction (CHD)

Welcome to the **Classification - Cardiovascular Risk Prediction (CHD)** project repository. This project focuses on predicting cardiovascular risk using classification techniques. The analysis is performed using Jupyter Notebook and a relevant dataset.

## Files

- `Toyaj_Yadav_Capstone_project_3_(ML_Classification)_(Cardiovascular_Risk_Prediction_CHD_).ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and analysis for predicting cardiovascular risk using classification methods. It covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insights.
- `data_cardiovascular_risk.csv`: The dataset containing relevant data for cardiovascular risk prediction.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Toyaj_Yadav_Capstone_project_3_(ML_Classification)_(Cardiovascular_Risk_Prediction_CHD_).ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment.
3. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, etc.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to replicate the analysis and classification process.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook covers data cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming data for classification analysis.
- **Feature Selection**: Explore feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features for predicting cardiovascular risk.
- **Classification Modeling**: Utilize classification algorithms to predict cardiovascular risk based on available features.
- **Evaluation and Insights**: Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and gain insights into factors contributing to cardiovascular risk.
